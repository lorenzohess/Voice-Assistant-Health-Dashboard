   - Workouts
2. Add new graphs for new data
3. Programmatic graph titles: <user input data name>
4. Adding new data and new graphs

11. Pi auto wakes up at 7AM to turn monitor on again
12. User can apply metrics to each graph which are displayed in a box next to the graph
    - Most recent data value
    - Average data value

    - If you think of other metrics let me know
    - User can select which metrics are applied to each graph
